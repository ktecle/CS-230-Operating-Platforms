# CS-230-Operating-Platforms
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS), the company I work with as a technology consultant, has taken a new client, The Gaming Room.
The Gaming Room company wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their exisitng game, Draw It or Lose It.
Draw It or Lose is currently available on an Android app only.
As a technology consultant for CTS, I am asked to prepare a software design decument that meets the requirements of the client. The client (The Gaming Room) has 
requested that the a game to have one or more teams, and each team to have multiple players assigned to it. Besides the client requested that each team names be unique
and only a single instance of the game be available at any given time.
In this design document, I have researched and documented the various operating platforms which are considered for the client's requirements and made recommendations with
regards to operating platforms, operating system architectures, storage management,  memory management, distributed system and networks and security.

Understanding the requirements of the client was highly important in developing the design document as well as the code. For instance as the client wants only one instance of the game to exist
in memory at any given time, CTS adopted Singleton patter in its design and development to meet the requirement. 
A detailed analysis and research went into preparing the design document. In this research and analysis, the pros and cons of various operating platforms was studied and a recommendation was 
made to best address the client's needs.

If I had to pick one part of the design document to revise, it would be operating platforms architecture. I am very interested in understanding software and operating platforms architecture, and I believe that with further research, I would be able to enhance the documentation.

In the future, if I had to prepare a design document, I would start with thorough understandign of the client's requirments, and conduct thorough research and analysis to identify suitable operating platform for the given scenario, by following industry best practice in my design process.
